# parallax

A basic way to create parallax effect during WebView scrolling using HTML-CSS and javascript.

On Mozilla firefox there is a glitch on images jumping while wcrolling the webview. Scrolling is perfect on Chrome and very minute glitch on Safari. Appreciate the help if someone points me out to the solution.
